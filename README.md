# GoGitUp

GoGitUp is a command-line tool that helps you manage and update multiple Git repositories efficiently. It scans configured directories for Git repositories and can update them all with a single command, handling both origin and upstream remotes.

## Features

- üîç Scan directories recursively for Git repositories
- üîÑ Update multiple repositories in parallel
- ‚ö° Fast repository discovery and caching
- üîí GitHub token support for private repositories
- üî± Support for fork workflow (origin/upstream remotes)
- üíæ Cache repository information for faster subsequent runs
- üö´ Skip repositories with unstaged changes

## Installation

### From Source

Requires Go 1.21 or later.

```bash
go install github.com/trutx/gogitup/cmd/gogitup@latest
```

### Manual Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trutx/gogitup.git
cd gogitup
make build      # Build the binary
make install    # Install to $GOPATH/bin
```

## Development

The project includes several Make targets to help with development:

```bash
make build      # Build the binary
make install    # Build and install to $GOPATH/bin
make test       # Run tests with race detection and coverage
make coverage   # Generate and view test coverage report
make lint       # Run Go vet
make clean      # Remove build artifacts and coverage files
make all        # Clean and build
```

## Configuration

Create a configuration file at `~/.gogitup.yaml` (or use `--config` flag):

```yaml
directories:
  - ~/code/projects
  - ~/repos
  - /path/to/repositories
```

For GitHub private repositories, set your GitHub token:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

## Usage

### Scan for Repositories

```bash
# Scan configured directories
gogitup scan

# Show verbose output
gogitup scan -v
```

### Update Repositories

```bash
# Update all repositories
gogitup update

# Show status information during update
gogitup update --stat

# Show verbose output
gogitup update -v
```

### Cache Management

Repository information is cached by default in:
- Linux: `~/.cache/gogitup/repositories.json`
- macOS: `~/Library/Caches/gogitup/repositories.json`
- Windows: `%LocalAppData%\gogitup\repositories.json`

You can specify a custom cache location with the `--repos-file` flag.

## Error Handling

GoGitUp handles various error scenarios:
- Repositories with unstaged changes are skipped
- Authentication errors for private repositories
- Invalid or corrupted Git repositories
- Inaccessible directories or files
